3. css files and html files

    We downloaded a template called Metronic, and for most parts of our website
    we have been using its elements and css style, but it is we who composite those
    elements together to form each page. Also, we mainly use bootstrap to
    structure the website so that for all pages we select appropriate elements and
    put together and edit them to match with the backend.


4. note

    There are maybe some buttons not working now, such as follow us on Facebook or subscribe our website mainly
    in footer part of the website, they are just for our website to look more professional.
    In addition, our website is mainly tested using Chrome, so there may be some tiny bugs in other browsers.(
    shouldn't be big issues).
